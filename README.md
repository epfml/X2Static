# X2Static vectors
This folder contains the code for training X2Static models.

## Code
The folder src contains the code and instructions to train and reproduce the models trained for our experiments.

## Evaluation
Our models are evaluated using the standard evaluation tool in the [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) repository by Facebook AI Research.

## Pretrained vectors
Pretrained vectors in .bin format can be download from t.b.a . They can be converted to standard word2vec format using the script provided in the src folder. For example, to convert "X2Static_best.bin" to "X2Static_best.vec", use
```
python convert_bin_to_w2v.py X2Static_best.bin X2Static_best.vec
```

## Dataset
Dataset in the required format from the code can be download from t.b.a.
